Light from the newly-risen sun fell into the room through a single window, draping its contents in a soft, warm blanket. Cool air from the mild Twyla morning carried the scent of blooming flowers and the promise of a beautiful spring day. Inside, a young woman stood staring into a tall mirror, lost in her thoughts.

She appeared largely human, though her sharply pointed ears and delicate facial features disclosed a mixed heritage. The pale skin of her face, dotted with freckles, gave contrast to her dark green eyes. Her hair matched the rising sun in its bright, reddish-orange color, its loose curls falling about her face and neck.

A soft knock at the door brought her out of her reverie. "Come in," she called.

The door opened and a broad, muscled, giant of a man ducked into the room. Camille smiled broadly and ran toward the visitor.

"Brin! Good morning!" She wrapped her arms around the man in a warm embrace, though with his huge stature it felt less like a hug and more like trying to wrap one's arms around a large oak tree. Standing at five-foot-six, she only came up to the man's collarbone.

"Good morning, Kimi!" the man boomed, returning her embrace with a laugh. "I see you're up already? And mostly packed, too," he said looking around the room.

"Yes," she said sheepishly, "I couldn't really sleep very well, so I was up early..."

"To be expected, I suppose," Brin chuckled. "Are you ready for your journey?"

"As ready as I'll ever be," Camille said, though she did not look as though she believed the words she spoke.

Brin smiled softly and took Camille's hand, sitting in a nearby chair as he did so. "Kimi, *you are ready* for this. Your twenty-first birthday was just months ago, and I've trained you as well as I know how."

"It's not my skill with sword or shield I'm worried about," she said with a sad smile.

"I know," Brin sighed. "But I've told you before: you've grown into a beautiful young woman. You have nothing to fear."

"If only my father thought as you do," Camille said bitterly.

"Let the Aspects worry about your father," he said with a firm look. "His refusal to accept you as you are says everything about him, and nothing about you."

"But what if there are others like him? What if people out there refuse to accept me just as he has?"

"Camille," Brin said, "you are *you*, and you are you no matter what anyone says. You carry great strength, and I'm not just talking about your muscles," he smiled. "Besides, I've been to the capital to train other fighters. People outside the village are much more open minded about this sort of thing."

Camille looked at him and smiled broadly. "Thank you, Brin. When you say it, I can almost believe it."

Brin pulled Camille close for a long hug. "I know things have been hard since your mother passed," he said. "She was a beautiful elf, and one of the kindest people I've ever known â€” and you carry more than her surname. I believe in you, Kimi."

"Thank you, Brin," Camille smiled. "Ever since I lost her, you've been the only person who believed in me."

"That's not true," Brin scolded. "The villagers may fear your father's retribution due to his status, but they adore you. None would turn you away if you needed them."

"Perhaps," Camille said. "But you are the one who took me in when my father kicked me out, and you are the one who taught me to defend myself."

"And it has been a true pleasure, except for my inability to keep you from favoring your left side," Brin replied teasingly.

Camille laughed. "I promise I'll train every day."

"You better," Brin said, smiling in return and rising from his chair. "Now let me help you with your things. The caravan will be leaving soon."

"Thank you," Camille said quietly. "For everything, Brin."

Brin stopped and turned back toward her. "You're welcome, Kimi. You've been like a daughter to me." He hugged her once more. "I'll miss you. Be sure to write if you can."

"I'll miss you too, Brin," she said quietly, a single tear running down her cheek.

Half an hour later, Camille pondered Brin's words as she bounced down the road in one of the caravan's wagons. "I guess I'll find out for myself soon enough," she thought to herself. She fished a crumped paper from her pack and looked over the letter from the Tholian Explorers Guild for the hundredth time. "In a few weeks I'll reach my destination. Hopefully I can find the purpose I'm searching for in Tella Lond."
